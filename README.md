Discord Blackjack bot inspired by the dank memer discord bot (https://www.dankmemer.lol/)
***

I needed a project outside of my GIS studies to expand my Python prowess and remembered dank memers super fun blackjack feature I used to play years ago. This is a severely neutered version at the moment, but I might expand it in the future to be a bit more comprehensive. For the time being, it remains as little more than a fun personal project for a private discord server.

**Current functions:**
- Responds to a few key phrases when name mentioned
- /blackjack: Plays blackjack!

**Possible changes:**
- Implement currency system, including player balance
- Create more functions for alternative means of increasing funds

**Known issues:**
- Dealer does not hit to 17 if they draw a soft hand *(Potentially fixed)*
- Hit/Stand buttons can sometimes take took long to appear (Python moment but this code is messy atm so maybe im the problem)
- Dealer hits even if player bust *(Potentially fixed)*
